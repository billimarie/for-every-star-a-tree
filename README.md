##  Mission & Impact
For Every Star A Tree is an official **501(c)(3) nonprofit** ([Candid](https://app.candid.org/profile/15433332/)) dedicated to cultivating biodiversity in Los Angeles County's desertified region through scalable, climate-resilient miniature forests.

---

##  Our Story  
Founded in 2021, we began with a single tree and have since grown into a thriving quarter-acre Tiny Forest, restoring desertified land with volunteer passion, ecological science, and open-source transparency.

##  How We Make a Difference

**Pocket Forests & Pollinator Habitats** 
Plant dense patches of native California trees, shrubs, and wildflowers to support biodiversity and pollinators across the Antelope Valley.

**Resilience through Community Engagement**  
Empower local residents to plant, water, and care for these living ecosystems—strengthening environmental stewardship from the ground up.

**Measurable Environmental & Social Impact**  
We monitor biodiversity via [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/for-every-star-a-tree/), track watering schedules, measure plant health and soil transformation, and log volunteer and visitor engagement.
