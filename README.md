# For Every Star, A Tree
> A website for growing a forest in the desert.

"For Every Star, A Tree" is currently in its first year. We are a community-led, grassroots, nonprofit organization that believes **local climate action can help rebalance the global climate crisis**.

Our current pilot site is a 10 acre lot in the desert of Antelope Valley (Los Angeles County, Southern California, United States). We are completely remote, off-grid, and based on unincorporated territory.

## Our Climate Action Plan
Our plan is to utilize the Miyawaki Forest method, along with specifically selected native and non-native plants which are known to quickly establish in our region and withstand heat, wind, and pests.

The goal will be to plant 30 - 50 different varieties of trees, shrubs, wildflowers, plants, grasses, and other plants within a 100ft2 space.

This community Miyawaki forest will be safeguarded by fencing, security cameras, and protective barriers. We have been raising funds for this project through individual donations, community partnerships, and generous angel investments.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to heal abandoned and degraded land in Antelope Valley through optimistic rewilding, compassionate earthcare, and dedicated community work.

For Every Star, A Tree heals abandoned land by cultivating little pocket forests and gardens, and offers these creatively-inspired sanctuary spaces to others who are seeking solace from grief, illness, or trauma.

We are compassionate caretakers of earth and the human spirit.

## Our Website
For Every Star, A Tree will continuously publish its website changes via GitHub.

We believe in technology's spirit of transparency, accountability, and global communications.

We want everyone, anywhere, to be able to join us as we collectively plant trees in the desert.
